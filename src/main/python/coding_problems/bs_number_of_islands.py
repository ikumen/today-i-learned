"""
Given a two-dimensional integer matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

Note: Neighbors can only be directly horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.

Constraints

    n, m â‰¤ 100 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix.
