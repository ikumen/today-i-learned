"""
You are given a two dimensional matrix where a 1 represents a live cell and a 0 represents a dead cell. A cell's (living or dead) neighbors are its immediate horizontal, vertical and diagonal cells. Compute the next state of the matrix using these rules:

    Any living cell with two or three living neighbors lives.
    Any dead cell with three living neighbors becomes a live cell.
    All other cells die.

Constraints

    n, m â‰¤ 500 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix
