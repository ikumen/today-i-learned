"""
You are given a list nums of length n + 1 picked from the range 1, 2, ..., n. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. Find and return it. There is guaranteed to be exactly one duplicate.

Bonus: Can you do this in \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) time and \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) space?

Constraints

n â‰¤ 10,000
