## Minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm

An example of a [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) using [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm). Just click on the yellow canvas to generate vertices of the spanning tree, as more vertices are added the algorithm will start to span the tree.
