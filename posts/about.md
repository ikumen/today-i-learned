# About

Hi, I'm Thong Nguyen. I'm a father, developer, and DIY enthusiast from Los Angeles. I spend most days hanging out with [these two](/static/images/kids.jpg), occasionally **[building things](/til/diy/)** and [growing stuff](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmdKkU6G). On spare nights I'm [learning to code](https://github.com/ikumen) or [helping others](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2264997/ikumen?tab=topactivity) with their code.
