"""
You are given a two-dimensional list of integers times where each list has two numbers [start, end], representing the start and end time of a course.

Return the maximum number of courses you can take assuming you can only take one course at a time and the start of a course needs to be later than the end of the last course.

Constraints

    n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of times
